			<p>I was not familiar with the phrase "Web 2.0" until I read the article. The world presented to me was new, modern and complete. Even it is the evolution of the internet, I feel confused of the structure. I may never have chance to see there were lots of things having been changed or enhanced. For example, the new web allows developers to stylize their page. The aesthetic was added to the whole thing. I had never thought about Web 1.0 would look like that, and 2.0 would be so much better. In his article "What is Web 2.0" , O'Reilly present the significant distinction of two versions. He pioneers my vision of not only web development but also treatment to Internet.</p>
